# meal-time

This is our final capstone project for Tech Elevator.

Meal TimE is a meal planning app that allows users to:
- create an account and log in, with all functionality dependent on being logged in
- pull in recipes from an external API and save them to a database
- save recipes to their individual collections
- search recipes both from the external API and the database
- create a Meal Plan and add recipes to specific meals (7 days a week, breakfast lunch dinner)
- automatically generate a grocery list with ingredients needed to make their meal plan

This project was built in two weeks in a 5-person group using Agile methodologies, with 3-day sprints. Primary technology includes:

- PostgreSQL database
- Java backend utilizing Spring
- Vue frontend with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Soon the project will be deployed to Heroku.
